# AI-Powered Terminal Emulator

A fully functional, AI-driven terminal emulator built with React, TypeScript, and advanced NLP capabilities. This hackathon-winning project combines traditional terminal functionality with natural language processing to create an intuitive command-line interface.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Terminal Functionality
- **Complete File System Operations**: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`
- **System Monitoring**: `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `free`, `df`, `uptime`, `sysinfo`
- **Utility Commands**: `echo`, `whoami`, `date`, `history`, `tree`, `find`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for invalid commands
- **Command History**: Navigate through previous commands with ↑/↓ arrows

### AI-Powered Natural Language Processing
- **Natural Language Commands**: Type in plain English and watch it convert to terminal commands
  - "create a folder called projects" → `mkdir projects`
  - "move file1.txt to documents folder" → `mv file1.txt documents/`
  - "show me system performance" → `top`
  - "list all files in current directory" → `ls`
- **Smart Auto-completion**: Intelligent suggestions based on context
- **Command Correction**: Automatic typo correction and command suggestions

### System Monitoring & Analytics
- **Real-time CPU Monitoring**: Live CPU usage, temperature, and core information
- **Memory Management**: Real-time RAM usage with visual indicators
- **Storage Analytics**: Disk usage monitoring and visualization
- **Network Statistics**: Upload/download speeds and network activity
- **Process Management**: View running processes with CPU and memory usage

### Professional UI/UX
- **Cyberpunk Theme**: Modern, professional terminal aesthetic
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Terminal Effects**: Authentic terminal animations and visual feedback
- **Professional Icons**: High-quality, consistent iconography throughout

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/NLP**: Hugging Face Transformers.js (runs entirely in browser)
- **System Simulation**: Advanced JavaScript-based system monitoring
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with custom terminal components

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-terminal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Basic Commands
```bash
# File operations
ls                    # List directory contents
cd projects           # Change directory
mkdir new-folder      # Create directory
touch file.txt        # Create file
rm file.txt           # Remove file
mv file.txt docs/     # Move file to directory
cp file.txt backup/   # Copy file to directory

# System monitoring
ps                    # Show processes
top                   # System performance monitor
free                  # Memory usage
df                    # Disk usage
uptime               # System uptime
sysinfo              # Complete system information
```

### Natural Language Commands
Instead of memorizing commands, just type what you want:

```bash
# Natural language → Command translation
"create a folder named test"           → mkdir test
"show me what's in this directory"     → ls
"move readme.txt to documents"         → mv readme.txt documents/
"check system performance"             → top
"how much memory is being used"        → free
"find all txt files"                   → find txt
```

### Advanced Features
- **Tab Completion**: Press Tab for intelligent command and file completion
- **Command History**: Use ↑/↓ arrows to navigate through previous commands
- **Error Assistance**: Get helpful suggestions when commands fail
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live system metrics update automatically

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **CommandProcessor**: Handles command parsing and execution
- **NLPProcessor**: Natural language understanding and command translation
- **SystemMonitor**: Real-time system metrics simulation
- **VirtualFileSystem**: In-memory file system implementation
- **Terminal**: Main UI component with professional styling

### AI/NLP Pipeline
1. **Input Processing**: Capture user input (natural language or commands)
2. **Intent Recognition**: Analyze input using Hugging Face models
3. **Command Translation**: Convert natural language to terminal commands
4. **Execution**: Process commands through virtual file system
5. **Response Generation**: Format and display results

## 🌟 Key Differentiators

1. **No API Keys Required**: Runs entirely in browser using Hugging Face Transformers.js
2. **Real System Simulation**: Accurate CPU, memory, and process monitoring
3. **Professional Design**: Cyberpunk-themed, production-ready interface
4. **Complete NLP Integration**: Every command works with natural language
5. **Hackathon Ready**: Fully tested, documented, and deployment-ready

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test production build locally
```

### Hosting Options
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo for automatic deployments
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop `dist` folder for instant hosting
