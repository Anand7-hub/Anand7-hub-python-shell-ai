## üé¨ SCRIPT

### Opening Hook (0-15 seconds)
**[Show terminal loading/opening]**

"Hey everyone! Welcome to the AI-Powered Terminal - the world's first terminal that actually understands what you're saying. Let me show you why this is going to change everything."

### Traditional Commands Demo (15-35 seconds)
**[Type commands with brief pauses]**

"First, let's see the traditional commands working perfectly:"

1. `ls` - "List files"
2. `mkdir hackathon` - "Create a directory"
3. `cd hackathon` - "Navigate into it"
4. `touch presentation.txt` - "Create a file"
5. `ls` - "And there it is!"

### The Magic - Natural Language (35-75 seconds)
**[Slower, more dramatic pacing]**

"But here's where it gets interesting. Watch this..."

1. **Type**: "create a folder called demo"
   - **Say**: "I'm typing in plain English... and look!"
   - **[Point to command translation]**

2. **Type**: "move presentation.txt to demo folder"
   - **Say**: "Moving files with natural language..."
   - **[Show file moved successfully]**

3. **Type**: "show me system performance"
   - **Say**: "And it even understands system commands!"
   - **[Display the beautiful top command output]**

### System Monitoring Showcase (75-105 seconds)
**[Highlight the professional UI]**

"Look at this professional system monitoring:"

1. `top` - "Real-time CPU, memory, and process monitoring"
2. `free` - "Memory usage with visual indicators"
3. `ps` - "Process management like a real terminal"
4. `df` - "Storage monitoring with beautiful visualizations"

### Advanced AI Features (105-130 seconds)
**[Demonstrate intelligence]**

"The AI doesn't just translate - it's smart:"

1. **Type**: "find all text files" 
   - **Say**: "It understands context and intent"

2. **Type**: "lst" (typo)
   - **Say**: "It even corrects your typos and suggests fixes!"

3. **Press Tab key**: "Smart auto-completion"
4. **Press ‚Üë arrow**: "Command history navigation"

### Technical Excellence (130-150 seconds)
**[Show the code/architecture briefly]**

"Built with cutting-edge technology:"
- "React and TypeScript for reliability"
- "Hugging Face AI running entirely in your browser"
- "No API keys needed - completely free!"
- "Real system simulation with accurate metrics"

### Problem It Solves (150-170 seconds)
**[Make it relatable]**

"This solves a real problem. How many times have you:"
- "Forgotten the exact syntax for a command?"
- "Wished you could just tell your computer what to do?"
- "Needed to monitor system performance but forgot the commands?"

"Now you can just... talk to your terminal!"

### Closing Impact (170-180 seconds)
**[Strong finish]**

"From complete beginners who've never seen a terminal before, to system administrators who want to work faster - this changes everything."

**[Type one final natural language command]**

**Type**: "show me everything in this directory"
**Say**: "The future of command-line interfaces is here, and it speaks your language."

**[End with terminal showing beautiful output]**
